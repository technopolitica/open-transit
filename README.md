[![Build Status](https://github.com/technopolitica/open-transit/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg?branch=mainline)](https://github.com/technopolitica/open-transit/actions?query=workflow%3ACI+branch%3Amainline++)
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/technopolitica/open-transit)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/technopolitica/open-transit)

Open Transit aims to be a complete implementation of the [Mobility Data Specification (MDS)](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/tree/2.0.0) version 2.0, published by the [Open Mobility Foundation](https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/).

The goals of Open Transit are simple:

- Strict adherence to MDS 2.0 and future supported revisions.
- Backwards compatible with all minor revisions of the current major MDS version, and with the previous major version (except 1.0, which will not be supported).
- Simple, easy deployments with minimal configuration needed for both agencies and providers.
